# About

I am Hisham Khdair, Ph.D. in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for education, teaching is an incredibly rewarding thing to do and I like to simplify complex computer concepts for me and everyone, making artificial intelligence and machine learning more accessible, and teaching people how to apply AI excites me. I started blogging about my experience and learning in the field in this blog. Please follow me for the updates and to get your support :hugs:
