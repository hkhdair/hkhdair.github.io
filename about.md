# About

I am Hisham Khdair, Ph.D. in Computer Science - Software Engineering, educator, researcher, and coder. I have a strong passion for education, teaching is an incredibly rewarding thing to do and making artificial intelligence and machine learning more accessible, and teaching people how to apply AI excites me.
